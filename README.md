# ToDoList
ToDo list is a simple tool that helps you keep track of your daily obligations so you don't forget anything.
## List Technologies Used
1. [Android Studio][2]
2. [kotlin programming language][3]
3. [Figma][4]
## User Stories
1. As a user, I'd like to add tasks to a list in order to better organize my time and save what I want to accomplish.
2. As a user, I'd like to select a task from the list and view the content of the previously completed work.
3. As a user, I'd want to modify a task from the list in order to change the text of a previously written task.
4. As a user, I want to remove the job from the list, as well as the contents of the previously typed task.
5. I'd like to update my profession status as a user so that I can see if a task has been done.
6. As a user, I'd like to be able to filter my task list so that I can see only the tasks that I'm interested in.
7. As the user, I'd like to order my task list alphabetically.
## Planning Development 
I started with a simple design in Figma, then coded for this project, and then updated the design in Android Studio.

## Problem-Solving Strategy
If I have an issue, I look for a solution on the internet, and if I can't find one, I consult an expert.

## Future Functions
1. Send a notification to use if the deadline task is due today.
2. Can add a place and send a notification to his user when he gets close to that location.
3. Update the design for the task of adding and displaying items.
## Favorite Functions
1. Task creation - The user can create as many tasks as he wants.
2. Current date of creation - When a user adds a task, the app automatically sends the current data to the database.
3. Display task - The title, description, deadline, and creation date can all be displayed.
4. Edit task - The user can make changes to any task he or she wants.
5. Delete task - The user has the ability to delete any task he or she want.
6. Filter - The list can be sorted by status and category.
