# ToDoList
ToDo list is a simple tool that helps you keep track of your daily obligations so you don't forget anything.
## List Technologies Used
1. [Android Studio][2]
2. [kotlin programming language][3]
3. [Figma][4]
## User Stories
1. I want to add tasks to the TODO LIST app so that the user may organize his time and save what he wants to do.
2. As a TODO LIST app, I want to show the user the content of the previously written task by displaying the item from the list.
3. As a TODO LIST app, I'd like to be able to update tasks from the list, allowing the user to change the content of previously typed tasks.
4. As a TODO LIST app, I want to be able to delete a task from the list so that the user can delete the task and what it contains.
5. I'd like to update the profession status in a TODO LIST app so that the user may see if a task has been finished.
6. As a TODO LIST app, I'd like to be able to filter my task list so that the user can see what he wants from all of his chores.
7. As a TODO LIST app, I'd like to order my list of tasks alphabetically so that the user can find what he's looking for.
## Planning Development 
I began with a basic design, then created coding for this project, and finally updated the design with the Figma application.



## Future Functions
1. Send a notification to use if the deadline task is due today.
2. Can add a place and send a notification to his user when he gets close to that location.
3. Update the design for the task of adding and displaying items.
## Favorite Functions
1. Task creation - The user can create as many tasks as he wants.
2. Current date of creation - When a user adds a task, the app automatically sends the current data to the database.
3. Display task - The title, description, deadline, and creation date can all be displayed.
4. Edit task - The user can make changes to any task he or she wants.
5. Delete task - The user has the ability to delete any task he or she want.
6. Filter - The list can be sorted by status and category.
